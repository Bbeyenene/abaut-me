              I have a Bachelors Degree in Biology. I worked as a Biology and Chimistry teacher, and as a Pedagogical Director for
              five years in Eritrea. After a while the political situation became horrible and I exiled to Libya crosssing
              sahara desert by car in 28 days. I am a challenger and I will over come any challenge in my life. Once I landed
              in the US, I worked as a sales person in a gas station, and as a taxi and uber driver. I also served as a leader 
              in the Eritrean Eri-Yiakl civic organization in Chicago, IL. I have a good communication, work in collaboration, 
              problem solving and leadership skills. If you want to know more about me, leave me your <a href="contact.html">message</a>.
