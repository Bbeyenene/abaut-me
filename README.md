# ABOUT ME
My about me page contains the HTML and CSS and some Images.
the `README.MD` and the `html` parts are in the about me directories, where as the `CSS` and `Images` are in Assets/CSS and Assets/Images respectively.

# HTML part
There are three file included `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, and `contact.html`. Each page includes the `head` and `body`. In the `head` there are links to a `reset.css`, bootstrap and the actual styling sheets, and the `body` contains the `header`, the `main body` and the `footer` in all the three pages.
The `header` and `footer` have the same contents in all the three pages, where as the `main body` is different.

# CSS
There are four styling sheet in the css directory `reset.css`, `index.css`, `portfolio.css`, and `contact.css` 
The `header` and `footer` styling is the same in all the three pages, where as the styling for the `main body` is different for the main body based on their contents.

# @media query 
To make the pages responsive to different computers and mobile phones, the media query is added at the bottom of each styling sheet other than the reser.css
This enables the my web pages to be clearly accessible by any browzer.
1. Mobile i.e. Screen size smaller than `425px` all the content to be in column.
2. Tablet i.e.  Screen size smaller than `769px` the header and nav bar to be in column and the body depends on the visiblity.
3. Laptop and Computers i.e. screen size above `769px` all the header bar and footer extends 100% width, while the main contents have a maximum width.
